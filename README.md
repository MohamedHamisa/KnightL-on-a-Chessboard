# KnightL-on-a-Chessboard

 we have given the value of n for an n x n chessboard, answer the following question for each (a,b) pair where 1 <= a,b < n:

What is the minimum number of moves it takes for KnightL(a,b) to get from position (0,0) to position (n - 1, n - 1)? If it's not possible for the Knight to reach that destination, the answer is -1 instead. then print the answer for each KnightL(a,b)
